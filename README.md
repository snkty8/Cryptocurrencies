# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.  However, the company is not well versed in the world of cryptocurrencies.  They have asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The data we will be working we is not ideal, and will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. There is no known output.  This is the perfect situation for unsupervised learning.
